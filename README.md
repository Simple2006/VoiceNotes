# VoiceNotes

VoiceNotes is an iOS application created to help students with learning disabilities. The incapability to understand speech is a serious issue for students with learning impairments. VoiceNote helps solve that problem with its ability to convert speech to text efficiently.

## General Information

VoiceNotes was created by me, a 14-year old high schooler at Lynbrook High School in November. I continued Development through January and have paused development since to pursue my interest in Machine Learning (ML). I started working on VoiceNotes after understanding that people with disabilities had trouble collecting information to later review in lectures. I thought that if I could create something that would record the lecture, and then convert it to text in the form of a text file, I would be able to help these students.

## Future Plans

Although development is currently paused, I plan on resuming it in the future. I hope to complete the app and release it to the AppStore for public use.
